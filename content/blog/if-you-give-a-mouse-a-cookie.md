Planning can devolve into this style of predicting a persona's next action with little or no justification:

<quote>If you give a user a login box, he's going to type in a username and password.</quote>

Things quickly devolve into flights of fancy.

<quote>When he arrives at the home page, he'll want to set up a new account.</quote>

This reduces a user to a ridiculous on-the-rails strawman.
