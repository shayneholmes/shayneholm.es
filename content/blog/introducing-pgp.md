## Now with 10Ã— more PGP! &#128272;

As of today my [contact page][contact] references [my public PGP key](/shayneholmes.asc), which is also now included on the site.

## Why PGP?

[OpenPGP][PGP] is a venerable standard for securing communications, predominantly email. It uses standard encryption and some smarts to make the world a more secure place.

## Why _anything_?

Partly because privacy should be more a feature of our lives, and encryption is one way to provide that.

Partly, it is a hobbyist thing. PGP lets you collect signatures and apply vaguely esoteric technical knowledge with a theoretical benefit to society. In this respect, it's strongly akin to HAM radio -- I don't think it's a coincidence that a fair number of vocal PGP advocates are also HAMs.

Anyway, feel free to drop me a (secure) line.
