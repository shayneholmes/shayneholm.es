Cal Newport's _Deep Work_ is a well-written overview of how to focus for fun and profit.

Divided conceptually into two parts: _Why_ to focus deeply, and _how_ to do it.

Newport is a concise and direct writer, and is eminently up to the challenge of explaining both areas, using examples alongside evaluations starting from first principles, making this an effective argument for and guide to focused work.

Basically, this book is a clarified version 

## Group therapy

I read this as part of a group at work, and it was valuable to discuss it in such a group: A lot of the friction in adopting focus-friendly behaviors is in the worry of how those behaviors will be perceived in the workplace. Talking about it in a group of co-workers is a helpful way to address challenges in a particular workplace.

There is also something heartening about having a group to take action with, when it involves setting expectations for behavior in the workplace: At least you won't be the only one trying it out!
